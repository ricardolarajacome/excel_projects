Based on the provided information, the net income of West Ridge North for the last year amounts to $416,139.

### 2. Property Valuation:

Net income serves as a crucial metric in determining the property's value and what Streit should be willing to pay for it.

Streit can use various valuation methods, such as the capitalization rate (cap rate) approach, to estimate the property's worth. The cap rate is calculated as the ratio of Net Operating Income (NOI) to Property Value.

Once Streit determines the appropriate cap rate for this investment, they can use the formula: [Property Value] = [Net Operating Income] / [Cap Rate] to estimate the property's value.

By leveraging the net income figure, Streit can make informed decisions regarding the purchase price and assess whether the investment aligns with its financial objectives.

In conclusion, the net income of West Ridge North provides valuable insights into its financial performance and serves as a foundational element in Streit's acquisitions model. Streit can utilize this information to determine the property's value and make informed decisions regarding the potential purchase, considering its renovation plans and long-term investment goals.
